## **Session 3**

### **Practice using CSS**

1. Start with a CSS Reset

However, a [CSS Reset](https://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/) allows you to start with a clean base, making it easier to style your website, with more predictable outcomes across the board.

2. Know when to use CSS shorthand

CSS shorthand enables you to set multiple properties of an element in a single line. Using shorthand saves space and takes less time to load. However, you shouldn't use it for everything. When you only need to set one or two properties – or you simply need to override something – longhand may actually be better. 

Something else to remember: **when you're using shorthand, the ignored properties will reset, which could have an undesirable effect**.

3. Keep it DRY ("Don't Repeat Yourself")

DRY means don't use the same bits of code over and over again. One way to keep things DRY in CSS is to group things together. Refactored and DRY!

4. Stop over-using !important

There are very few occasions where you need to use !important. Only use !important when it's absolutely necessary.

5. Keep consistent

Some people order their properties alphabetically, while others use more of a logical approach – for example, organising things by line length or type. Whatever you choose, stick with it so it's easy to find things later.

6. Name things intelligently

- Avoid presentation words: These are the ones that involve color and display location (for example, green-text or top-menu-bar).

- Only use lowercase: CSS is case-sensitive, so don't create names like, MeNuBaR. It should be noted, however, that camel case (menuBar) is an acceptable practice, just not preferred in some cases.

- Separate multiple words using a dash: For example, main-menu. You may also use camel case (mainMenu), but again, this is often not preferred.

- Don't be too specific: You'll end up using multiple selectors for the same type of element. For instance, list-one and list-two can be combined, creating a single list-items.

7. Add comments when appropriate

- Commented code: If you comment out a specific portion of code, for a particular reason, leave a comment explaining that reason. If you don't, you may not remember why you commented it out in the first place.

- Hot fixes: If you add a 'hot fix', it might be a good idea to add a comment explaining it too.

- Reminders: You're likely working on more than one project at any given moment. If your attention is pulled before you have a chance to complete something, you can use comments as a reminder for what you still have left to do.

- Explanations: If a section of code is unclear, and you feel an explanation would help clear it up, then add a comment – it's that simple.

8. Explore Flexbox

The Flexible Box Layout module (or Flexbox)  gives you complete control. Using flex containers and flex items you're able to precisely define how things look. Flexbox also enables you to arrange items vertically on a page, which wasn't possible with floats.
